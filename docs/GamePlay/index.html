    <p>
      In a far away place, in another time, a King was the protector of his kingdom. 
      Everyone loved him, because he was the most benevolent King they had had. He cared for 
      every single person in his kingdom and since his first day, vowed to put every life in 
      his kingdom bfore his own. The people, although they loved him, thought this was just hyperbole, 
      the king would not put his life last, he was human, and humans were selfish.
    </p>

    <p>
      Time passed, and everyone forgot about this promise, the kingdom was at the longest period of peace 
      they had enjoyed, and there was no way to destroy that. Or so they thought. One day, at the crack of dawn, 
      the people woke up to see their king walking the streets, with his trusty sword and bow, a bad of bombs and 
      many more items. He was walking with purpose, like never before, and the people were scared. What was happening? 
      Why was their king armed to the teeth?

      The answer came as a roar out of the forest. The monsters had allied before The Boss, a mythical five headed monster 
      that had been rumored ot kill countless soldiers. This was the moment where the people remember their Kings promise, 
      the one they had cast out as an exageration. The moment the King stepped out of the fortress walls, order his men to 
      close them, and told them to keep them that way until he was back the people realized, they king was ready to sacrifice 
      his live to save theirs, and they hope he wouldn’t have to, but they couldn’t do anything now.
