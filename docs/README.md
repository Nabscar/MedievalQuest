## Goal of this project

Our goal for this project was to create an interactive fun game for people to play, so that they would be able to invest their time in quarentine towards an entretaining idea.

Here is a video that displays what how the game plays and the usage of items such as your bombs, potions, or your bow. 
However, the final frame/boss frame is removed and kept a surprise for the player to reach on their own.

## Software Impact Statement 
In our specific case, the ethical considerations of our project weren't so impactful. Since we just wanted to create a fun game for people to play with, our stakeholder were the players. The only impact on them would be having an amazing time when playing, and deciding they want more. There are no big unintended consequences we could think of when developing this software in real world scenarios. The only unitended consequence we could think of would be creating an amazing franchise of games that redefines gaming for all ages (just like The Legend of Zelda, the game which gave us our idea, did).
