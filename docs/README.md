## Software Impact Statement 
In our specific case, the ethical considerations of our project weren't so impactful. Since we just wanted to create a fun game for people to play with, our stakeholder were the players. The only impact on them would be having an amazing time when playing, and deciding they want more. There are no big unintended consequences we could think of when developing this software in real world scenarios. The only unitended consequence we could think of would be creating an amazing franchise of games that redefines gaming for all ages (just like The Legend of Zelda, the game which gave us our idea, did).
