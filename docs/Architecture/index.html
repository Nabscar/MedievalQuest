  <h6>Here you will find the structure of the code for the game and diagrams illustrating how to interpret the classses and
  functions you will find</h6>
  
  <h4>Usage</h4>
  <p>
  The usage of this game is really simple. Once the Installation procedure has been done, just go to the folder 
  where game.py is in your computer and run
  <pre><code>python game.py</code></pre>
  in the terminal. Once you have done this, a screen will pop up showing you the first frame of the game. Now in game, 
  you only need to use WASD to move (W is forwards, A if Left, S is Backwards, and D is Right) and the use J to attack 
  with your sword, K to shoot your arrows (once acquired), L to place bombs (if you have them), and I to use Health 
  Potions (If you have them)
  </p>

  <h4>Architecture</h4>
  <p>
  For the architecture of the game, we were able to very easily settle on what we currently use. We started by listing 
  the classes we would need and separate them in different inheritance levels.

  This slowly evolved into our current achitecture.The easiest way to explain it is throught a series of nested flow 
  diagrams. The biggest one the shows the <b>overall architecture and run of the code</b> is this one.<br>

  As you can see, the most important part of this one is the <b>MainQuest</b>, which can be seen in more detail in the 
  following diagram.<br>

  As you can see,<b>MainQuest</b> has to very important parts, which can both be seen in more detail below. On the left, you can see how <b>LoadSprites</b> runs, and on the right, you can see how <b>MainLoop</b> works.
