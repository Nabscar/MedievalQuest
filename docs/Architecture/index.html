  <p><strong>Here you will find the structure of the code for the game and diagrams illustrating how to interpret the classses and
    functions you will find</strong></p>
  
  <h4>Usage</h4>
  <p>
  The usage of this game is really simple. Once the Installation procedure has been done, just go to the folder 
  where game.py is in your computer and run
  <pre><code>python game.py</code></pre>
  in the terminal. Once you have done this, a screen will pop up showing you the first frame of the game. Now in game, 
  you only need to use WASD to move (W is forwards, A if Left, S is Backwards, and D is Right) and the use J to attack 
  with your sword, K to shoot your arrows (once acquired), L to place bombs (if you have them), and I to use Health 
  Potions (If you have them)

  <h3>Project evolution/narrative</h3>
  <p><b>Medieval Quest was a game that evolved in a very simple and straightforward manner. We started by 
  working on three different fronts:</b></p>

  <h4>Architecture</h4>
  <p>
  For the architecture of the game, we were able to very easily settle on what we currently use. We started by listing 
  the classes we would need and separated them in different inheritance levels.

  This slowly evolved into the current architecture.The easiest way to explain it is through a series of nested flow 
  diagrams. The biggest one shows the <b>overall architecture and run of the code</b> through this diagram.<br>
  <img src="images/Overall.png">
  As you can see, the most important part of this diagram is the <b>MainQuest</b>, which can be seen in more detail in the 
  following diagram.<br>

  As you can see,<b>MainQuest</b> has two very important parts, which can both be seen in more detail below. On the left, 
  you can see how <b>LoadSprites</b> works, and on the right, you can see how <b>MainLoop</b> works.

  <h4>Visual Origin</h4>
  <p>
  In our case, we both had very similar ideas to what our game should look like, 
  so we just started working on images which eventually developed into bakcgrounds, enemies, and the player.

  <h4>Game Layout</h4>
  <p>
  The game layout was fairly easy to do. When we started we settled on the idea of a 3x3 grid of frames,
  since this was a big enough number for the world to feel semi-developed but small enough for it to be 
  achievable between the two of us. We also decided we should have caves, and both of us agreed that two 
  caves seemed to be the right number of caves for our 3x3 world. Initially our overall design was the following:

  Which afterwards evolved into this design (Which is the hand-drawn sketch of the design we actually use for our levels):
