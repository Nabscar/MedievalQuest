  <h6>Here you will find the structure of the code for the game and diagrams illustrating how to interpret the classses and
  functions you will find</h6>
  
  <h4>Usage</h4>
  <p>
  The usage of this game is really simple. Once the Installation procedure has been done, just go to the folder 
  where game.py is in your computer and run
  <code>python game.py</code>
  in the terminal. Once you have done this, a screen will pop up showing you the first frame of the game. Now in game, 
  you only need to use WASD to move (W is forwards, A if Left, S is Backwards, and D is Right) and the use J to attack 
  with your sword, K to shoot your arrows (once acquired), L to place bombs (if you have them), and I to use Health 
  Potions (If you have them)
